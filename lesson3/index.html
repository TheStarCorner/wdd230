                 Nintendo created a great layout for their webpage when it comes to visual hiearchy. With some websites, your eye might only 
                 be focused on one part of the screen. On the other hand, the layout of this webpage makes everything have weight with
                 everything is placed. Your eye is intrigued by the ad for a new game ("Metroid Dread" for this
                 example), and your eye moves all over the screen with the varied shapes.
              </p>
              <p class="about-p">
                Visual hiearchy with web design creates a sense of balance and eye movement
                throughout a design. It is all balanced and nothing feels out of place. There is usually
                one part of a piece of design that sticks out as the most important, but does not feel
                like it ruins the flow of a page.

              <p class = "about-p">
                  The whole idea of repetition for this webpage is the "Featured" section 
                  of the Pizza Hut mobile site. This helps the whole layout to feel consistent and organized. If the layout was all
                  over the place, the whole webpage would fall apart design-wise. Repetition might sound like a waste of time for web design, but 
                  it keeps the layout organized.

                  There is a sense of padding with the layout of the Codecademy mobile webpage.
                  Many parts of the paged is spced out to create a sense of even padding. 
                  With white space, the whole "spacing" aspect of web design is important 
                  for organization. The whole layout could be ruined if the spacing was reduced
                  too much or increased too much.
